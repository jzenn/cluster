Documentation of ``cluster``
============================

This is a lightweight clustering package implementing Spectral Clustering as well as k-Means Clustering.
For an overview over the topic
the following reference by Prof. Ulrike von Luxburg might be a good start.

*Ulrike von Luxburg (2007). A tutorial on spectral clustering. Stat. Comput., 17(4), 395â€“416.*

Installation
------------

You can simply install the package with ``pip`` directly from the repository. ::

  pip install git+https://github.com/jzenn/cluster

The package requires at least *Python 3.6* to work properly. Additonal dependencies are:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib (just for visualizations, not necessarily needed)

* ``cluster.graph`` is a lightweight graph implementation.
